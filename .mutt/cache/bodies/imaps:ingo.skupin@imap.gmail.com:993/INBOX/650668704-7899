Congratulations! You may now call yourself an official Dudeist Priest. You can also call yourself a Reverend, Minister, Cleric, Rabbi, or whatever you like. If you're interested in officiating at wedding ceremonies, please contact your local county clerk first to see if they recognize your new status as an ordained Minister.<br />
<br />
If they require a printed Certificate of Ordination or a Letter of Good Standing, we can provide those for you via our store: http://dudeism.com/store. You can also find other cool stuff there.<br />
<br />
Why not put your new status as a Dudeist Priest in your email signature or as a banner on your website? To find out how, please visit <a href="dudeism.com/link-to-us">this page</a>. Thanks!<br />

Sometimes your county clerk or marriage office will require information about the church. For the current mailing address and phone number of the church, please email<br />
<a href="mailto:information-request@dudeism.com">information-request@dudeism.com</a><br />
