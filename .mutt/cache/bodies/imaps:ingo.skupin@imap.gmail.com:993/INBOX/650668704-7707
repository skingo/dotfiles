Hi Ingo Skupin

It has been some time since you last used Doodle. Maybe Doodle is just
not for you, or maybe there is a feature you are waiting for? We are
constantly updating our features and we would love to get your
thoughts: http://doodle.com/inactiveSurveyEN

If you are about to organize a meeting and have not fixed a date and
time yet, try Doodle and see how easy it is. Start at
