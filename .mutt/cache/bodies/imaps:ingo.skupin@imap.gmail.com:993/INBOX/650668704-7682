As previously announced, the file services for Ubuntu One have been discontinued.  Your data is available for download until the end of July - if you haven't taken action already, you need to do so now in order to ensure you have a copy of all your data.

In order to make it easy for you to retrieve all of your content, we have released a new feature that lets you download all your content at once. Our website (https://one.ubuntu.com/) has been updated with instructions on how to conveniently download all your files.

In addition, you still can use Mover.io's offer to transfer your data to another cloud provider for free. And the Ubuntu One web interface is available for you to download individual files.

The previously announced option of downloading your files as a zip file is producing unreliable results for a small number of users and therefore we have removed that option. If you already retrieved your files as a zip file, we encourage you to check for the validity of the zip file contents. If there are problems with that file, please use one of the options above to retrieve a complete copy of your data.

Remember that you will have until 31st July 2014 to collect all of your content. After that date, all remaining content will be deleted.

We know you have come to rely on Ubuntu One, and we apologise for the inconvenience this closure may cause.  We've always been inspired by the support, feedback and enthusiasm of our users and want to thank you for the support you've shown for Ubuntu One.

The Ubuntu One team
