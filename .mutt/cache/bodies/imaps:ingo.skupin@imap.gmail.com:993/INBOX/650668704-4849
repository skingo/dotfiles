Thank you for registering your Nessus scanner with Tenable. The Nessus HomeFeed subscription will keep your Nessus scanner up to date with the latest plugins for vulnerability scanning.

(Note: If you use Nessus in a professional capacity, you need a ProfessionalFeed subscription.)

Your activation code for the Nessus HomeFeed is 
74EA-281E-553E-6812-D8C3

This is a one-time code. If you un-install and then re-install Nessus, you will need to register the scanner again and receive another Activation Code.

Activating your HomeFeed Subscription
Activate your subscription by entering the Activation Code using the procedures below:

After the initial installation of Nessus, the final process will load a local configuration page in your default web browser. This page will begin a brief process to set up the scanner including creating an account, registering the scanner with your activation code, specifying a proxy (optional), downloading the plugins, and initializing Nessus for use.

Please consult the Nessus 5 Installation guide located at http://www.nessus.org/products/nessus/documentation for more information on this setup process.

No Internet Access on your Nessus system?
If your Nessus installation cannot reach the Internet, you will need to follow an alternate procedure to get the URL and challenge code for downloading the latest plug-ins. You can find offline registration instructions at:

http://static.tenable.com/documentation/Nessus_Activation_Code_Installation.pdf

If you have any questions, visit the Nessus discussion forum at https://discussions.nessus.org/.
